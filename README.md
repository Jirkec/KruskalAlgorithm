# Minimum Spanning Tree – Kruskal’s Algorithm (C Implementation)

This project implements Kruskal’s algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph. The program is written in C and is designed to read graph data from input files, process the MST using classic algorithms, and output the results.

## Key Features

- **Kruskal’s Algorithm:**  
  Efficient computation of an MST for any undirected, weighted graph using greedy edge selection and disjoint-set (union-find) structures.

- **Flexible Input:**  
  Reads vertex and edge data from input files for easy adaptation to different graph instances.

- **Clean Output:**  
  Exports the resulting minimum spanning tree edges to a specified output file for further analysis or visualization.

- **Structured, Readable Codebase:**  
  Modular implementation using clearly separated source files for main execution, graph parsing, MST logic, and utility functions.
